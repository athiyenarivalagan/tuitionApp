We have created a dynamic world map using Maps Javascript Api.The purpose of the map is to display the locations of the registered tutors.
When a tutor creates a profile,the address provided by the user is geocoded and turned into coordinates which will be converted into markers that will pin and display their location on the map.
The location will be enetered by the user in the tutor profile creation page.
That address will then be dispalyed on the map using a marker pin.
