MAP PROCESS:
------------
We have created a dynamic world map using Maps Javascript Api.The purpose of the map is to display the locations of the registered tutors.
When a tutor creates a profile,the address provided by the user is geocoded and turned into coordinates which will be converted into markers that will pin and display their location on the map.
The location will be enetered by the user in the tutor profile creation page.
That address will then be dispalyed on the map using a marker pin.

ELECTRON USE:
-------------
Commands to test via electron: 
open a terminal/cmdprompt in the project folder
1) npm install --save-dev electron
2) npm start

The configurations are already done in main.js and git pushes will not include the node_modules folder that consist of electron (due to file size limit).
